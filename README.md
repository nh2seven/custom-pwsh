# Custom PWSH
Welcome to my personal PowerShell configuration. This work-in-progress repo will be a collection of scripts and settings I use to make the best use of PowerShell.
### Requirements
- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (preferred)
- PowerShell 7.x, PowerShell 5.x also works just fine
- Nerd Fonts (any font that supports glyphs)
- Oh-My-Posh
### Setup
> Note: This setup is an abstraction of what can already be found online. The original sources have been linked in the References section. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
1. Clone this repo to your local machine / copy the JSON file contents to your desired location
2. Open PowerShell and navigate to the cloned directory
3. Run `setup.ps1` (will be added in a later commit)
4. Open a new PowerShell window and enjoy your new prompt!
